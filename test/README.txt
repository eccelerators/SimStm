This is the testbench test and profiling area.
the tests are to test the default instructions to ensure the full ability of a command is tested.
Each command has one or more tests in the "self_test" directory.

The profiles directory currently has no tests but is intended to proved some tests that will
enable the effectiveness to be mesured.
