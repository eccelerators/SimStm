This repository is currently under construction.
It currently houses the bare minimum file set to enable use.
The users document has been updated with the latest feature changes and addtions.
ttb_gen has been recoded, again,  so that it is able to use default packages on most Unix systems.

Next will be some initial examples copied from the existing release
Some self test and profiling tests will be added

Then some more complicated examples that will added

Last step will be to re-write the test bench package to use  "line" type insteade of hard coded strings.  This is a large effort.

The latest checkins fix some major bugs in string conversions between different base represetations.
It is suggested that the current version of this code NOT be used in production environments.
It is currently considered untested, and therefore may not work as intended by the author.
